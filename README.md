# Covid-19 exploratory data analysis using Nextstrain dateset
The whole world is suffering the wrath of Covid-19 and I think it’s the need of the hour that we should devote our energies in exploring such field for the betterment of well-being. Therefore it’s the time to spend our energies in understanding and exploring available information regarding this virus. The dataset used for this exercises is a part of Uncover Covid-19 Challenge at Kaggle. I'm using a subpart of that dataset with the name of the directory "nextstrain". We are going to use pandas for the analysis, while seaborn and matplotlib for the visualization. Here following is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/roche-data-science-coalition/uncover. Let’s try to answer few basic questions regards to the spread of virus:
## Which region is mostly effected by Covid-19?
## How genders are effected by the virus in the world? 
## Which age group is more prone to the virus? 
## Which are the top ten countries fighting Covid-19? 
## What is the status of virus spread in the Divisions of Top 10 countries? 
## What is the status of virus spread in the Divisions of Top 10 countries based on their genders? 
## What is the status of virus spread in the Divisions of Top 10 countries based on their age groups?
